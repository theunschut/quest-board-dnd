</details>

## Phase Details

### Phase 26: Namespace Rename

**Goal**: The codebase uses QuestBoard.* namespaces consistently with no behavior change and all 191 tests pass
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v5.0)
**Requirements**: RENAME-01, RENAME-02, RENAME-03, RENAME-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Every C# file uses QuestBoard.* namespaces — no EuphoriaInn.* string remains in source or migration Designer files
  2. All project files (.csproj), the solution file (.slnx), and directory names reflect the QuestBoard naming
  3. All config files (appsettings*.json), GitHub Actions workflows, and deployment references are updated
  4. `dotnet build` succeeds and all 191 existing tests pass with zero behavioral change

**Plans**: 2/2 plans complete
**Wave 1**

- [x] 26-01-PLAN.md — git mv directory/solution/project renames + bulk EuphoriaInn→QuestBoard content replace + dotnet build gate

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 26-02-PLAN.md — full 191-test gate + final grep-clean + human verify + single atomic commit (D-05) + documented production systemd pre-deploy step

### Phase 27: Group Schema Foundation

**Goal**: The database schema supports multiple groups — GroupEntity and UserGroups tables exist, GroupId FKs are on shared-resource entities, and all existing data is correctly seeded into the EuphoriaInn group
**Depends on**: Phase 26
**Requirements**: GROUP-01, GROUP-02, GROUP-03, GROUP-04, GROUP-05, GROUP-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. GroupEntity table exists with Id, Name, CreatedAt; EuphoriaInn group is seeded as GroupId = 1
  2. UserGroups junction table exists with UserId, GroupId, GroupRole (Player/DungeonMaster/Admin enum); all existing users are assigned to EuphoriaInn with their current role
  3. QuestEntity and ShopItemEntity have a non-nullable GroupId FK pointing to GroupEntity
  4. AspNetUserRoles contains no Player, DungeonMaster, or Admin entries after migration — only SuperAdmin assignments remain
  5. All migrations apply cleanly on a fresh database and on the existing production schema

**Plans**: 3 plans

**Wave 1**

- [x] 27-01-PLAN.md — GroupRole enum + Group/UserGroup entities & domain models + GroupId FK on Quest/ShopItem + UserGroups nav + QuestBoardContext config + EntityProfile mapping (model layer, build gate) — completed 2026-06-30

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1)*

- [x] 27-02-PLAN.md — atomic AddGroupSchema migration (8 FK-safe steps) + TestDataHelper GroupId=1 + full 194-test gate — completed 2026-06-30

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2)*

- [x] 27-03-PLAN.md — apply migration on dev SQL Server + verify GROUP-04/05/06 seeding + document Phase 27-29 co-deployment constraint — completed 2026-06-30

### Phase 28: Tenant Isolation

**Goal**: All quests and shop items are scoped to the active group via EF Core Global Query Filters; Hangfire jobs cross-group correctly; all existing tests pass with the filter in place
**Depends on**: Phase 27
**Requirements**: TENANT-01, TENANT-02, TENANT-03, TENANT-04, TENANT-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. IActiveGroupContext is defined in the Domain layer; ActiveGroupContextService reads the active group from ASP.NET Core Session in the Service layer
  2. A user in Group A cannot see quests or shop items belonging to Group B under any normal navigation path
  3. All four Hangfire email jobs send correctly scoped emails without relying on Session (explicit groupId parameter or cross-group sweep where appropriate)
  4. The integration test factory registers a stub IActiveGroupContext returning GroupId = 1; all existing tests pass after filter addition
  5. UserEntity has no query filter — login, password reset, and email confirmation continue to work correctly

**Plans**: 3 plans

**Wave 1**

- [x] 28-01-PLAN.md — IActiveGroupContext (Domain) + ActiveGroupContextService + SessionKeys + MutableGroupContext + TestDatabase fix + WebApplicationFactoryBase stub + QuestBoardContext HasQueryFilter + Program.cs DI registration — completed 2026-06-30

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1)*

- [x] 28-02-PLAN.md — IQuestRepository cross-group method + QuestRepository IgnoreQueryFilters impl + dispatcher interface/concrete/null groupId threading + job SetGroupId wiring + DailyReminderJob cross-group sweep + unit test updates — completed 2026-06-30

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2)*

- [x] 28-03-PLAN.md — cross-group isolation integration tests + full suite gate + human verify checkpoint — completed 2026-06-30

### Phase 29: SuperAdmin Role & Management Area

**Goal**: A SuperAdmin can log in, reach a dedicated management area, and fully manage groups and their members; existing Admin and DungeonMaster authorization continues to work via per-group roles in UserGroups
**Depends on**: Phase 28
**Requirements**: AUTH-01, AUTH-02, AUTH-03, AUTH-04, AUTH-05, MGMT-01, MGMT-02, MGMT-03, MGMT-04, MGMT-05, MGMT-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. SuperAdmin Identity role exists in AspNetRoles and is seedable at startup; a SuperAdminOnly authorization policy protects the management area
  2. Admin-scoped pages (AdminOnly policy) correctly authorize users whose UserGroups.GroupRole is Admin for the active group; SuperAdmin bypasses group role checks entirely
  3. DM-scoped pages (DungeonMasterOnly policy) correctly authorize users whose UserGroups.GroupRole is DungeonMaster or Admin for the active group; SuperAdmin bypasses
  4. SuperAdmin can view all groups with member counts, create a new group, edit a group name, and delete an empty group via the /platform area
  5. SuperAdmin can add any existing user to any group with a specified GroupRole and remove a user from a group via the /platform area

**Plans**: 5 plans

**Wave 1** *(parallel — no overlap in files_modified)*

- [x] 29-01-PLAN.md — Auth handler rewrite (AdminHandler, DungeonMasterHandler) + IUserService/UserRepository extensions (GetGroupRoleAsync, SetGroupRoleAsync) + UserRepository IActiveGroupContext injection + GetAllPlayers/GetAllDMs fix + AdminController IActiveGroupContext + promote/demote fix + Users role badges fix + SuperAdminOnly policy (completed 2026-06-30)
- [x] 29-02-PLAN.md — EF Core migration: SuperAdmin role seeding (AspNetRoles Id=4, Name="SuperAdmin") (completed 2026-06-30)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on 29-01)*

- [x] 29-03-PLAN.md — Group service layer: IGroupService, IGroupRepository (Domain), GroupWithMemberCount DTO, GroupService, GroupRepository, DI registrations (completed 2026-06-30)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on 29-03)*

- [x] 29-04-PLAN.md — Platform MVC Area: GroupController (5 actions), 5 Razor views, _Layout.Platform.cshtml, _ViewImports.cshtml, _ViewStart.cshtml, PlatformViewModels, area route in Program.cs (completed 2026-06-30)

**Wave 4** *(blocked on 29-01, 29-02, 29-03, 29-04)*

- [x] 29-05-PLAN.md — Integration tests: AdminHandlerIntegrationTests (8), PlatformAreaIntegrationTests (4), GroupManagementIntegrationTests (10) — 219/219 tests pass (completed 2026-06-30)

### Phase 30: Group UX & Admin User Creation

**Goal**: Users land in the right group context after login, can switch groups, see the active group in navigation, and group admins can create new users — self-registration is no longer publicly available
**Depends on**: Phase 29
**Requirements**: UX-01, UX-02, UX-03, UX-04, UX-05, MGMT-07, MGMT-08, REG-01, REG-02, REG-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A user in exactly one group is automatically placed in that group's context after login with no picker shown; a user in multiple groups sees a group-picker page
  2. SuperAdmin always sees the group-picker after login and can enter any group or navigate directly to the management area
  3. The active group name and a "Switch group" link are visible in the navigation bar; clicking "Switch group" returns the user to the group-picker
  4. The active group selection persists in ASP.NET Core Session across requests until the session expires or the user switches groups
  5. A group admin can create a new user account within their group (assigning a GroupRole), which triggers the existing email confirmation flow; that user cannot self-register via the public registration page
  6. A group admin can promote or demote users within their group between Player, DungeonMaster, and Admin roles

**Plans**: 5/5 plans complete
**UI hint**: yes

**Wave 1** *(parallel — no overlap in files_modified)*

- [x] 30-01-PLAN.md — GetGroupsForUserAsync service/repo method + GroupPickerController (Index GET auto-redirect/picker + SelectGroup POST) + GroupPickerViewModel + picker views (desktop/mobile) + _Layout.GroupPicker.cshtml + SessionKeys.ActiveGroupName (UX-01..UX-04)
- [x] 30-03-PLAN.md — CreateUserViewModel + AdminController.CreateUser GET/POST + CreateUser views (desktop/mobile) + ?? 1 fallback removal (AdminController.Users + UserRepository) (MGMT-07, MGMT-08, REG-02, REG-03)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on 30-01)*

- [x] 30-02-PLAN.md — AccountController.Login POST redirect to GroupPicker + Register GET/POST removal + Register views deleted + Create Account links removed (REG-01)
- [x] 30-04-PLAN.md — Nav group display: _Layout.cshtml + _Layout.Mobile.cshtml group-switch item reading SessionKeys.ActiveGroupName (UX-05)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on 30-01, 30-02, 30-03, 30-04)*

- [x] 30-05-PLAN.md — GroupPickerControllerIntegrationTests + Register tests → 404 + AdminController CreateUser tests + full-suite green gate + blocking human-verify checkpoint

### Phase 31: Unauthenticated landing redirect

**Goal:** Unauthenticated visitors are redirected to login (not shown empty/broken group-scoped pages), a public landing page lives at `/`, the quest board moves to `/quests`, and authenticated users with an expired group session are seamlessly recovered to the group picker.
**Requirements**: UX-01, UX-04
**Depends on:** Phase 30
**Plans:** 4/4 plans complete

**Wave 1** *(parallel — no overlap in files_modified)*

- [x] 31-01-PLAN.md — class-level [Authorize] on Calendar + QuestLog controllers; remove [AllowAnonymous] from DM profile actions (D-01, D-02)
- [x] 31-02-PLAN.md — QuestController.Index at /quests + public landing HomeController.Index + migrate quest views to Views/Quest + new landing views + reference sweep (D-04..D-08)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on 31-02)*

- [x] 31-03-PLAN.md — GroupSessionMiddleware (session-recovery redirect) + Program.cs registration + [Route("groups/pick")] on GroupPicker (D-09, D-10, D-11)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on 31-01, 31-02, 31-03)*

- [x] 31-04-PLAN.md — update Calendar/QuestLog/Home tests + /quests route tests + new GroupSessionMiddleware tests + full-suite gate + blocking human-verify

### Phase 32: First-login password flow

**Goal:** Admin-created accounts are created with no password; the new user receives a single "Welcome — set your password" email whose link both sets their password and confirms their email in one click. Existing users can self-recover access via a rate-limited, enumeration-safe "Forgot password?" flow that reuses the same password-set landing page. The old admin-set-password field and the separate confirm-email-only flow are retired.
**Requirements**: PWFLOW-01, PWFLOW-02, PWFLOW-03, PWFLOW-04, PWFLOW-05, PWFLOW-06
**Depends on:** Phase 31
**Plans:** 5/5 plans complete

**Wave 1** *(parallel — no overlap in files_modified)*

- [x] 32-01-PLAN.md — Service layer: passwordless `CreateUserAsync`, `GeneratePasswordResetTokenForUserAsync`, `ConfirmEmailDirectlyAsync` across `IIdentityService`/`IdentityService`/`IUserService`/`UserService` (PWFLOW-01, PWFLOW-02, PWFLOW-03 backend)
- [x] 32-02-PLAN.md — Email jobs + templates + Program.cs config: `WelcomeEmailJob`/`ForgotPasswordEmailJob` + `Welcome.razor`/`ForgotPassword.razor` + delete `ConfirmationEmailJob`/`ConfirmEmail.razor` + `EmailPreviewController` swap + `TokenLifespan` 7d + `AddRateLimiter` (PWFLOW-04 config, PWFLOW-05 job, PWFLOW-06) + job unit tests

**Wave 2** *(blocked on 32-01, 32-02)*

- [x] 32-03-PLAN.md — `AccountController` ForgotPassword + SetPassword actions + `ForgotPasswordViewModel`/`SetPasswordViewModel` + Account views (desktop/mobile) + Login "Forgot password?" link (PWFLOW-02, PWFLOW-03, PWFLOW-04 UI)
- [x] 32-04-PLAN.md — `AdminController` passwordless CreateUser + retargeted SendConfirmationEmail (Welcome) + `CreateUserViewModel` password removal + CreateUser views + Users.cshtml button relabel (PWFLOW-01, PWFLOW-05)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on 32-03, 32-04)*

- [x] 32-05-PLAN.md — Integration tests (ForgotPassword/SetPassword enumeration-safety + rate limit + passwordless-login-fails + Admin Welcome-resend) + delete `ConfirmationEmailJobTests` + full-suite green gate + blocking human-verify checkpoint

### Phase 33: Session persistence — persist ActiveGroupId across app restarts via distributed cache

**Goal:** `ActiveGroupId` survives an app restart — ASP.NET Core Session is backed by `AddDistributedSqlServerCache` against the existing SQL Server (no re-pick after every deploy) — and the repeatable manual admin email-send buttons (`SendConfirmationEmail`, `EditUser` email-change) are rate-limited per target user (3/hour) to protect the Resend relay's quota, while one-shot automated sends (`CreateUser` welcome email) stay exempt.
**Requirements**: SESSION-01, SESSION-02, EMAIL-RATE-01, EMAIL-RATE-02, EMAIL-RATE-03, EMAIL-RATE-04
**Depends on:** Phase 32
**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

**Additional scope item (added 2026-07-01):** Rate-limit manual/admin-triggered email-sending actions (e.g., "Resend Welcome Email" on `/Admin/Users`, `EditUser`'s email-change confirmation) to protect the mail relay's send quota from accidental button-mashing by admins who don't know the limit. User's stated preference: only endpoints triggered by a repeatable manual button need limiting — one-shot automated processes (e.g., `CreateUser`'s welcome email, enqueued once per new account) do not. `ForgotPassword` already has a rate limiter (Phase 32, PWFLOW-04); this extends the same pattern to the admin-side manual-send endpoints. Resolved in planning: limit is 3/hour per **target user** (not admin IP); enforced programmatically via an injected `PartitionedRateLimiter<int>` inside the action body (RESEARCH corrected CONTEXT.md's `GetRouteValue` approach — `userId`/`Id` are POST form fields unavailable to a pre-model-binding policy factory).

**Wave 1**

- [x] 33-01-PLAN.md — session persistence: `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.SqlServer` 10.0.9 + `AddDistributedSqlServerCache` (Testing-guarded) before `AddSession` + raw-SQL `AddSessionStateTable` migration with `COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS` (SESSION-01, SESSION-02)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on 33-01 — shares Program.cs)*

- [x] 33-02-PLAN.md — admin email rate limiting: singleton `PartitionedRateLimiter<int>` (3/hour, key `email-resend:{userId}`) + `AttemptAcquire` guards in `SendConfirmationEmail` and `EditUser`'s email-change branch; `CreateUser` exempt (EMAIL-RATE-01..04)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on 33-01, 33-02)*

- [x] 33-03-PLAN.md — EMAIL-RATE integration tests + full-suite green gate + blocking human-verify checkpoint (session table schema SESSION-02 + restart survival SESSION-01)

### Phase 34: Codebase Cleanup & Security Hardening — Mechanical Cleanup slice (34a)

**Goal:** Complete the low-risk, zero-behavior-change mechanical-cleanup slice of the v5.0 closing pass: remove confirmed-dead code (`RegisterViewModel`, D-04/D-05); strip GSD-ID/phase/review-finding comment tags codebase-wide (D-06) while preserving genuinely useful "why"/landmine comments (D-08); backfill `/// <summary>` XML docs on all 35 public Domain + Repository interfaces (D-07); and capture the clean dependency vulnerability scan as D-09/D-10 evidence.
**Requirements**: None (cleanup/hardening phase — tracked via CONCERNS.md items + CONTEXT.md decisions D-01..D-10)
**Depends on:** Phase 33
**Plans:** 5/5 plans complete

**Phase split (per D-03, pre-approved):** The full CONCERNS.md scope (~26 fix items + 120 comment occurrences + 35-interface doc backfill, 60-80+ file touches) exceeds one phase's full-fidelity budget. This Phase 34 covers the **mechanical-cleanup** slice only. The remaining CONCERNS.md fixes were split into **Phase 34.1 (Security & Bugs)** and **Phase 34.2 (Performance & Architecture)** — see summary list above; each needs `/gsd-plan-phase 34.1` / `/gsd-plan-phase 34.2` before execution.

**Wave 1** *(all 5 plans parallel — disjoint file sets: dead-code, impl-source comments, test comments, Domain interfaces, Repository interfaces)*

- [x] 34-01-PLAN.md — delete RegisterViewModel (D-04/D-05) + run & capture dependency vulnerability scan evidence (D-09/D-10)
- [x] 34-02-PLAN.md — strip ID/phase comment tags from 9 non-test source files (D-06/D-08)
- [x] 34-03-PLAN.md — strip ID/phase comment tags from 21 test files (108 occurrences) (D-06/D-08)
- [x] 34-04-PLAN.md — backfill `<summary>` XML docs on 26 Domain interfaces + strip embedded tags from 3 partial-coverage docs (D-06/D-07)
- [x] 34-05-PLAN.md — backfill `<summary>` XML docs on 9 Repository-layer interfaces (D-07)

### Phase 34.1: Security & Bugs

**Goal:** Fix the Known Bugs and Security Considerations items catalogued in `.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md`, plus their related Test Coverage Gaps: verify-and-close the stale `SessionReminderJob` null-dereference claim (already null-safe per Phase 34 RESEARCH.md — confirm and document, don't re-fix); implement Resend API 429 rate-limit retry-with-backoff; add a CSRF `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]` regression test across all state-changing controller actions; verify email-configuration secrets never appear in logs or exception traces. Deferred from the Phase 34 split per CONTEXT.md D-03 — part of closing the v5.0 Multi-Tenancy milestone alongside Phase 34 and Phase 34.2.
**Requirements**: None mapped — cleanup/hardening phase; tracked by CONCERNS.md item names.
**Depends on:** Phase 34
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 34.1-01-PLAN.md — Code fixes: Production startup email-config validation, Resend 429 retry-with-backoff (testable ResendStatsClient seam), Resend-token + secret-logging documentation

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 34.1-02-PLAN.md — Regression tests: 429 retry unit tests, CSRF [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] reflection sweep, SessionReminderJob null-dereference verify-and-close

### Phase 34.2: Performance & Architecture

**Goal:** Fix the Tech Debt, Performance Bottlenecks, Fragile Areas, Scaling Limits, and Dependencies at Risk items catalogued in `.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md`, plus remaining Test Coverage Gaps: `QuestController`/`AdminController` cleanup via selective service-layer extraction + MVC-boilerplate helpers (no physical controller split, per 34.2-CONTEXT.md D-01/D-02), `DateTime.Now` → `UtcNow` fix in `ShopSeedService`, follow-up quest two-phase-update consolidation into a service method, composite index on `Quests(IsFinalized, FinalizedDate)`, shop-item query projection, Hangfire job scope-management helper + `AutomaticRetryAttribute` retry policy (not the nonexistent `UseAutoRetry` API — see Phase 34 RESEARCH.md), EF Core Global Query Filter documentation, AutoMapper enum-cast validation test, `ActiveGroupId` null-guard, and dependency migration-plan documentation (Identity email sender routing, Resend SMTP single-point-of-failure). Cross-controller `Forbid()` defense-in-depth checks and Hangfire job-queue batching are documentation-only in this phase (deferred code implementation, per D-06/D-09). Deferred from the Phase 34 split per CONTEXT.md D-03 — part of closing the v5.0 Multi-Tenancy milestone alongside Phase 34 and Phase 34.1.
**Requirements**: None mapped — cleanup/hardening phase; tracked by CONCERNS.md item names + CONTEXT.md decisions D-01..D-11.
**Depends on:** Phase 34, Phase 34.1 (AdminController.cs is restructured by 34.1's Resend extraction before 34.2's further service-layer extraction — see 34.2-CONTEXT.md D-05)
**Plans:** 2/5 plans executed

**Wave 1** *(parallel — disjoint file sets: follow-up service / MVC helpers+Admin / EF+perf+retry / jobs+docs)*

- [x] 34.2-01-PLAN.md — follow-up quest two-phase consolidation into `QuestService.CreateFollowUpQuestWithDetailsAsync` (D-01/D-04) + `DateTime.Now`→`UtcNow` in ShopSeedService
- [x] 34.2-02-PLAN.md — net-new `ControllerExtensions` MVC-boilerplate helpers (D-02) applied to AdminController user/quest-admin actions (Resend/EmailStats excluded per D-03)
- [ ] 34.2-03-PLAN.md — composite index `Quests(IsFinalized, FinalizedDate)` migration (D-07) + shop list-query projection (D-08) + Hangfire `AutomaticRetryAttribute` retry policy + query-filter documentation comments
- [ ] 34.2-04-PLAN.md — `HangfireJobHelper` scope-management helper applied to 3 jobs + documentation-only notes (Forbid() D-06, Hangfire batching D-09, dependencies-at-risk, enum-cast convention)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on 34.2-03)*

- [ ] 34.2-05-PLAN.md — `ActiveGroupId` `RequireActiveGroupId` null-guard (ASVS V4) + AutoMapper enum-cast round-trip test + Group Query Filter enforcement test + Hangfire retry-policy test
